Python Implementation of Doubly Linked List

Data object that links nodes of values to one another through pointers.
The list has methods to append/insert/remove/get elements, return a string representation of the list, and rotate the list left by one.
Contains a header and trailer attribute which allows for O(n/2) insertion and removal time. Utilizes iterative indexing approach for both insertion and removal.
Also contains test cases in the main section to test edge cases and general functionality.
